# Constructing a complete Machine Learning Pipeline: Titanic Survival Prediction
> The objective of this classification model was to understand the data, perform Feature Engineering and construct a fundamental Machine Learning Pipeline.

> In the project I learnt and deployed concepts like Visualization, Data cleaning, making Custom Transformation Pipelines, selecting the best parameters using GridSearchCV and Randomized SearchCV, various Model Evaluation Metrics.

> The model predicts if a boarded passenger survived in Titanic giving best accuracy Random Forest Classifier.
